# 🔥 BINARY SEARCH – MUST-DO LIST (≤ 15)

## 🟦 CLASSIC FOUNDATION (Warm-up but non-optional)

1. Binary Search
2. First Bad Version
3. Search Insert Position

> These test if you can write **bug-free binary search** (yes, many can’t).

---

## 🟩 ROTATED / VARIANT ARRAYS (VERY HIGH PROBABILITY)

4. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
5. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
6. Find Peak Element

👉 Tests logic, not syntax.

---

## 🟨 LOWER / UPPER BOUND & COUNTING LOGIC

7. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
8. Count of Occurrences in a Sorted Array

> Interviewers want to see if you understand **boundaries**, not just `mid`.

---

## 🟥 BINARY SEARCH ON ANSWER (THIS IS THE REAL GAME)

9. Koko Eating Bananas
10. Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days
11. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets
12. Split Array Largest Sum

👉 If you can explain *why the predicate is monotonic*, you’re golden.

---

## 🟪 MATRIX / 2D VARIANTS (SNEAKY BUT COMMON)

13. Search a 2D Matrix
14. Search a 2D Matrix II

---

## 🟧 ADVANCED BUT INTERVIEW-RELEVANT

15. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

> Not always asked — but if it is, this separates **elite** from **average**.

---

## How You Should Prepare These (IMPORTANT)

For **every problem**, be able to say:

* What is the **search space**?
* What is `low` and `high`?
* Why is the condition **monotonic**?
* Why does the loop terminate correctly?

If you can’t answer these → interviewer knows you memorized.

## Common Interview Mistakes (Avoid These 😌)

❌ Infinite loops
❌ `mid` overflow
❌ Wrong boundary update
❌ Blind `while(l <= r)` everywhere

Binary search is not hard.
**Sloppy thinking is.**
