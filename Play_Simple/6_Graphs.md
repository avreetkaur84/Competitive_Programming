# 🌐 GRAPHS – MUST-DO INTERVIEW QUESTION LIST 

## 🟦 GRAPH BASICS (You must be calm here)

1. BFS of Graph
2. DFS of Graph
3. Number of Connected Components
4. Graph Valid Tree
5. Clone Graph                                  🔴 Revisit

👉 Tests traversal confidence and visited logic.

## 🟩 CYCLE DETECTION (VERY COMMON)

6. Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph (DFS/BFS)                   🟢 Done  
7. Detect Cycle in Directed Graph                               🟢 Done  
8. Course Schedule (Cycle Detection using DFS / Kahn’s)            
9. Course Schedule II

👉 If you can explain **why recursion stack works**, you win.

---

## 🟨 TOPOLOGICAL SORT (HIGH ROI)

10. Topological Sort (DFS)
11. Topological Sort (BFS / Kahn’s Algorithm)

---

## 🟥 SHORTEST PATH / BFS VARIANTS

12. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph
13. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
14. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
15. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
16. 0–1 BFS

👉 Interviewers usually want **intuition**, not full math.

---

## 🟪 GRID-BASED GRAPH PROBLEMS (VERY LIKELY)

17. Number of Islands    
18. Max Area of Island
19. Flood Fill                                                  🟢 Done  
20. Rotten Oranges
21. Walls and Gates                                                 
22. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow                                 🔴 Revisit 
23. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

👉 These show BFS/DFS mastery in disguise.

---

## 🟧 UNION FIND (DISJOINT SET)

24. Number of Provinces
25. Redundant Connection
26. Accounts Merge
27. Graph Valid Tree (Union-Find)

👉 If you know **path compression + rank**, you’re safe.

---

## 🟫 MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (LIGHT BUT IMPORTANT)

28. Kruskal’s Algorithm
29. Prim’s Algorithm

---

## 🟨 ADVANCED BUT INTERVIEW-RELEVANT

30. Word Ladder
31. Alien Dictionary
32. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
33. Evaluate Division
34. Reconstruct Itinerary
35. Find Eventual Safe States

---

## How to Prepare Graphs (This Is Crucial)

For every problem:

* Is it **BFS or DFS**? Why?
* When do I mark visited?
* What’s the time complexity?
* Can I reduce space?

If you hesitate on **visited logic**, redo.
