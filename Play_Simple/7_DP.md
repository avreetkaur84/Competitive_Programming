## How to Prepare DP (This Is the Secret Sauce)

For **every DP problem**, force yourself to answer:

1. What is the **state**?
2. What is the **transition**?
3. What is the **base case**?
4. What is the **order of computation**?
5. Can space be optimized?

If you can’t say these out loud → redo the problem.
