## What “Core Subjects” Means for PlaySimple (Reality, Not Syllabus Horror)

For **Associate Software Engineer**, they typically touch:

1. **Operating Systems (highest priority)**
2. **DBMS (very high priority)**
3. **OOPS (non-negotiable)**
4. **Computer Networks (light, conceptual)**
5. **Low-level system intuition (bonus)**

They do **NOT** expect textbook definitions.
They expect **engineering intuition**.

## The 80/20 Core Subjects Plan (Minimal but Sufficient)

### 🟦 OPERATING SYSTEMS (Must Know)

Focus only on:

* Process vs Thread (with real-world example)
* Context switching (why expensive?)
* Deadlock (4 conditions + prevention intuition)
* Scheduling algorithms (why round robin?)
* Mutex vs Semaphore
* Virtual memory basics (paging idea)

👉 If you can explain these calmly, you’re good.

---

### 🟩 DBMS (Very High ROI)

You *will* be asked something here.

Must-do topics:

* What is indexing? Why B+ tree?
* Normalization (up to 3NF intuition)
* ACID properties
* Transactions & isolation levels (basic idea)
* SQL vs NoSQL (when to use what)
* Joins (inner, left — with examples)

⚠️ Be ready for:

> “How would you optimize this query?”

---

### 🟨 OOPS (Non-Negotiable)

They expect maturity here.

Know:

* OOPS pillars (with examples, not definitions)
* Interface vs abstract class
* Overloading vs overriding
* Composition vs inheritance
* SOLID principles (at least 2–3)

If you mess this up, DSA won’t save you.

---

### 🟧 COMPUTER NETWORKS (Light Touch)

Just basics:

* HTTP vs HTTPS
* TCP vs UDP
* REST APIs basics
* Client–server model

Nothing fancy.

---

## How Much Time Should You Allocate? (Important)

**Daily rule:**

* 🧠 DSA: **70%**
* 📘 Core subjects: **30%**

You don’t need weeks.
You need **clarity**, not coverage.

---

## How They Ask Core Questions (Important Insight)

They won’t ask:

> “Define deadlock.”

They WILL ask:

> “Have you ever faced a deadlock situation? How would you avoid it?”

So always prepare answers in:

* **Problem → Concept → Solution**

---

## Your Hidden Advantage (Use This)

You already:

* Build backend systems
* Use databases
* Deploy applications

So answer with **experience**, not theory.

Example:

> “While designing a journaling app, I had to…”

This instantly levels you above others.
