# Data Structures & Algorithms / Competitive Programming

This repository is my personal knowledge base for **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **Competitive Programming**, implemented in **C++**.

It contains curated problems, scratch implementations, contest practice, and notes collected throughout my learning journey. Rather than storing every solution, the focus is on problems and concepts worth revisiting for deeper understanding and long-term revision.

## What this repository represents

* structured practice across core DSA concepts
* implementation of data structures and algorithms from scratch
* curated problems with strong learning value
* contest experience and experimentation
* notes, patterns, and observations from problem solving

The goal is simple: build strong intuition, maintain a reliable revision system, and continuously improve problem-solving ability.
